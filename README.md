This is the front end for the fortnox web-app. It is written using the React library, less for styling and react-testing-library for testing.
Use `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to run the application. For running the tests run `npm test`. I am using some
proprietary images and logo from Fortnox, I hope this is not an issue as this is only for demonstration and the project will be deleted after
the review.
